It was a very cold winter morning when Simon realised
His music collection was missing!!
He started looking in the attic
The he heard a strange sound
It reminded him of a song he had heard in his youth
It came from a cracking old radio
<<<<<<< HEAD
It was Led Zepplin
=======
The song was the sound of the underground by the spice girls
